#So here, a polinomial is going to be in the format of a list,
#where each new element is to the power of whatever number in
#the list it is. For example, [1,4,3] would represent y=3x^2+4x+1.
polynomial = [1,4,3]

#Now we have to make a basic function that evaluates the function
#at a specific value of x
def EvalPoly(poly,x):
    total = 0
    listnum = 0
    length = len(poly)
    while n > 0:
        total += poly[a] * x**a
        length -= 1
        listnum += 1
    return float(total)
